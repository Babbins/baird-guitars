## BB-1

Hollow body electric fretless

For this bass i wanted to make a hollow body instrument that might look like a solid body electric at first glance and could at least be loud enough for the player to hear it and enjoy its sound unplugged.

- Shielded hand wound single coil with hum canceling dummy coil
- 34" scale
- Alder top and back with maple sides and mahogany neck and end blocks
- Wenge fingerboard with port orford cedar neck, bolt-on
- Hand cut brass tail piece and bridge
- Zebra wood and wenge details
