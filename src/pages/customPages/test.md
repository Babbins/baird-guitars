## PICK-UPS

![split coils](/img/img_3720.jpg "split coils")

\-A hand made set of split coil pick-ups made for Ali Mahmoud's guitar. The split coil pick ups are hum canceling like a humbucker, and have more lower response on the lower three strings and more higher sound response for the higher three strings because of each coils placement (like a p-bass pick-up). Each coil is then wrapped with copper shielding which makes the sound of the pick up even cleaner on top of the hum canceling of the split coils ; )
